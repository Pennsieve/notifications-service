## Notifications

The notifications api sends messages to individual users via websocket connections. Messages can be sent via an SQS queue or the REST API.

- the NotificationsSink is a MergeHub, meaning that it can accept new sources (from api requests) at any time.
- the NotificationsSource is a BroadcastHub, meaning that it can accept new websocket connections from new users at anytime.
- all messages go to every user connection, but each source is filtered so that only the messages addressed to a particular user will make it through.
